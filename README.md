# TigerMenus
Solves problem of students having to check six different web pages to see current menus.

Scrapes menu data daily for all six dining halls and displays on a single page for easy comparison.

25,000+ page views,  ~300 daily unique users to date.

Hosted at https://tigermenus.herokuapp.com/

It sure was fun learning Python, Flask, BeautifulSoup, GitHub, and Heroku in order to develop this!

I plan to add more features to it (user accounts, email notifications when dumplings are being served, better UI and design overall, a database to store many months of information so other people can use it, making a version of the site for grad students to use since they actually go frist/frick cafe, equad cafe, eating club menus, vegan color coding, etc.) Please tell me about features you want added or even submit a pull request! I even have a feedback form hooked up to google forms!

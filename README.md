# tiger_menus
Scrapes all 6 of Princeton dining hall's today menus and displays information on a single page

Hosted here:
https://tigermenus.herokuapp.com/

I plan to add more features to it (making the sections bolded, moving main entrees to the top, user accounts, email notifications when dumplings are being served, better UI and design overall, adding a database so it doens't scrape on every page load, more columns, adding the grad college, making a version of the site for grad students to use since they actually go frist/frick cafe, equad cafe, etc.) Please tell me about features you want added or even submit a pull request!
